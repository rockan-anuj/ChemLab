Its action is due to the bromide ion. Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, in antiepileptic medication for dogs.\nUnder standard conditions, potassium bromide is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to the properties of the potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting.",

The two cyano groups are bonded together at their carbon atoms, though other isomers have been detected. The name is also used for the CN radical, and hence is used for compounds such as cyanogen bromide (Br−C≡N) (but see also Cyano radical). When burned at increased pressure with oxygen, it is possible to get a blue tinted flame, the temperature of which is about 4,800 °C (8,670 °F) (a higher temperature is possible with ozone).

Its structure is <span class=\"chemf nowrap\">N≡C−C≡N</span>. The simplest stable carbon nitride, it is a colorless and highly toxic gas with a pungent odor. The molecule is a pseudohalogen. Cyanogen molecules are linear, and consist of two CN groups ‒ analogous to diatomic halogen molecules, such as Cl<sub>2</sub>, but far less oxidizing. The two cyano groups are bonded together at their carbon atoms, though other isomers have been detected. The name is also used for the CN radical, and hence is used for compounds such as cyanogen bromide (<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">Br−C≡N</span>) (but see also <i>Cyano radical</i>). When burned at increased pressure with oxygen, it is possible to get a blue tinted flame, the temperature of which is about 4,800 °C (8,670 °F) (a higher temperature is possible with ozone). It is as such regarded as the gas with the second highest temperature of burning (after dicyanoacetylene).</p>"

It exothermically reacts with water to produce oxonium hexafluorophosphate ([H3O]+[PF6]−) and hydrofluoric acid. Additionally, such solutions often contain products derived from hydrolysis of the P-F bonds, including HPO2F2, H2PO3F, and H3PO4, and their conjugate bases. Hexafluorophosphoric acid attacks glass. Upon heating, it decomposes to generate HF. Crystalline HPF6 has been obtained as the hexahydrate, wherein PF−6 is enclosed in truncated octahedral cages defined by the water and protons. NMR spectroscopy indicates that solutions derived from this hexahydrate contain significant amounts of HF.",

Hexafluorophosphoric acid is only stable in solution, decomposing to HF and PF<sub>5</sub> when dry. It exothermically reacts with water to produce oxonium hexafluorophosphate (<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">[H<sub class=\"template-chem2-sub\">3</sub>O]<sup class=\"template-chem2-sup\">+</sup>[PF<sub class=\"template-chem2-sub\">6</sub>]<sup class=\"template-chem2-sup\">−</sup></span>) and hydrofluoric acid.

In this compound, technetium has an oxidation state of +6, the highest oxidation state found in the technetium halides. In this respect, technetium differs from rhenium, which forms a heptafluoride, ReF7. Technetium hexafluoride occurs as an impurity in uranium hexafluoride, as technetium is a fission product of uranium (spontaneous fission in natural uranium, possible contamination from induced fission inside the reactor in reprocessed uranium). The fact that the boiling point of the hexafluorides of uranium and technetium are very close to each other presents a problem in using fluoride volatility in nuclear reprocessing.",

This anhydrous compound is a mauve-colored solid that rapidly absorbs water on exposure to air to form a purple-colored hexahydrate, NdCl3·6H2O. Neodymium(III) chloride is produced from minerals monazite and bastnäsite using a complex multistage extraction process. The chloride has several important applications as an intermediate chemical for production of neodymium metal and neodymium-based lasers and optical fibers. Other applications include a catalyst in organic synthesis and in decomposition of waste water contamination, corrosion protection of aluminium and its alloys, and fluorescent labeling of organic molecules (DNA).",

It is a crystalline solid with a unit cell that contains two curium atoms and three oxygen atoms. The simplest synthesis equation involves the reaction of curium(III) metal with O2−: 2 Cm3+ + 3 O2− ---> Cm2O3. Curium trioxide can exist as five polymorphic forms. Two of the forms exist at extremely high temperatures, making it difficult for experimental studies to be done on the formation of their structures. The three other possible forms which curium sesquioxide can take are the body-centered cubic form, the monoclinic form, and the hexagonal form.

Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, in antiepileptic medication for dogs.\nUnder standard conditions, potassium bromide is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to the properties of the potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting.",

It is an ionic, water-soluble, and deliquescent compound that can be used in medicine as a substitute for potassium iodide.\nIt is also used as a scintillation gamma radiation detector, typically doped with europium, due to its optical clarity, relatively high density, high effective atomic number (Z=48), and high scintillation light yield. In recent years, europium-doped strontium iodide (<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">SrI<sub class=\"template-chem2-sub\">2</sub></span>:<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">Eu<sup>2+</sup></span>) has emerged as a promising scintillation material for gamma-ray spectroscopy with extremely high light yield and proportional response, exceeding that of the widely used high performance commercial scintillator <span class=\"chemf nowrap\">LaBr<sub class=\"template-chem2-sub\">3</sub></span>:<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">Ce<sup>3+</sup></span>.

This material is produced after uranium mining but before either fuel fabrication or uranium enrichment. Yellowcake concentrates are created through various extraction and refining methods that vary depending on the ore types. The production involves milling and chemical processing of uranium ore, resulting in a coarse powder with a pungent odor that is insoluble in water. Yellowcake typically contains about 80% uranium oxide and melts at approximately 2880 °C.",

Hydrolysis products of rutherfordine are also found in both the mineral and organic fractions of coal and its fly ash and is the main component of uranium in mine tailing seepage water.</p>"

The phase formed at ambient pressure by reaction of ZrO2 and WO3 is a metastable cubic phase, which has negative thermal expansion characteristics, namely it shrinks over a wide range of temperatures when heated. In contrast to most other ceramics exhibiting negative CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion), the CTE of ZrW2O8 is isotropic and has a large negative magnitude (average CTE of −7.2 × 10−6K−1) over a wide range of temperature (−273 °C to 777 °C). A number of other phases are formed at high pressures.",
